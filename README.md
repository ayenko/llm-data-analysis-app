## Course Description

<p>In this quick, hands-on course, learn to build a lightweight, AI-powered data analysis tool using Python, Streamlit, and the OpenAI API. Instructor Maggie Ma shows you how to upload a dataset and ask questions in plain English—your app will convert the input into code (Python or SQL), run it, and return useful insights. Perfect for technical teams looking to support non-technical stakeholders, this course takes you through building and testing a natural language interface for structured data. No prior experience with LLMs is needed—just Python and a bit of pandas—and you’ll finish the course with a working prototype you can expand or deploy internally.</p>
<p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out “GitHub Codespaces setup" with this course to learn how to get started.</p>
